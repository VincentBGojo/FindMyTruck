Welcome in the Projet d'Apothéose FIND MY TRUCK.

## [Your wish is my command](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6okxuiiHx2w)

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn `

Install all dependencies included in package.json.

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist/` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

## Change port

you may encounter a problem if you try to open the front and the back projets at the same time during your test session (yarn start stuff).

To change the port (8080), open `projet-find-my-truck-front/config/webpack.dev.js` and change `const port = 8080;` to whatever port you want.
